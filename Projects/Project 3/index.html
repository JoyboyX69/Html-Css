        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p class="p1">A mountain is a large natural elevation of the Earth's surface, typically rising steeply from the
            surrounding
            land. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, volcanic activity, or the folding and faulting of
            Earth's crust. They often have steep slopes, a defined peak or summit, and rugged terrain.

            Mountains can be found all over the world and play a crucial role in influencing climate and weather
            patterns. They are home to diverse ecosystems and are important sources of freshwater, as many rivers
            originate from mountain glaciers and snowmelt.

            Famous mountain ranges include the Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, and Alps, with Mount Everest being the highest
            peak on Earth. Mountains also hold cultural, spiritual, and recreational significance in many societies.</p>

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p class="p1">Mountains are some of the most majestic and awe-inspiring natural formations on Earth. They rise
            dramatically from the land, formed over millions of years by powerful geological forces such as tectonic
            collisions, volcanic eruptions, and the shifting of Earth's crust. Towering peaks like the Himalayas, Andes,
            and Rockies not only define the landscape but also play a vital role in maintaining the planet’s ecological
            balance. Mountains are essential sources of freshwater, as they store snow and glaciers that feed rivers and
            lakes.Their high altitudes create unique habitats for a wide variety of plant and animal species that are
            not found anywhere else. Beyond their ecological importance, mountains hold deep cultural and spiritual
            significance for many communities and are popular destinations for adventure seekers, offering activities
            like hiking, climbing, skiing, and paragliding.</p>

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p class="p1">Mountains are more than just towering landforms—they are ancient storytellers of the Earth’s
            history. Some of the oldest mountains, like South Africa’s Barberton Greenstone Belt, are over 3.5 billion
            years old, predating even complex life. Beneath their rugged surfaces, mountains act as climate regulators,
            capturing moisture and creating “rain shadows” that shape entire ecosystems. Surprisingly, mountains
            continue to grow—Mount Everest rises by a few millimeters each year due to tectonic activity. Despite harsh
            conditions, high-altitude environments support unique organisms like the snow leopard, the edelweiss flower,
            and even microscopic extremophiles that survive in icy crevices. Culturally, many ancient civilizations
            believed mountains were the homes of gods—Mount Olympus in Greece and Mount Kailash in Tibet are still
            considered sacred. In some regions, mountain air is known to contain negative ions that may boost mood and
            energy levels. Mountains are not just natural wonders; they are dynamic, living landscapes that shape life,
            belief, and survival in remarkable ways.
